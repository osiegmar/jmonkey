These are some curiosities found during the development of this project:

* The Amiga versions have several rooms stored on two disks (identical duplicates). In the English version it's room number 39 (*hellmaze*), 44 (*masters-h*), 61 (*sword-mas*) and 65 (*hellhall*). Maybe this was done in order to reduce floppy disk changes during the game when there was space left on the disk anyway. Although, at least the French version has no redundant rooms.
