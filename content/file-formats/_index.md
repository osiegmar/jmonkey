[The Secret of Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island) consists of a couple of files in four categories:

* [Index file](index-file.md) (000.LFL) allows quick access to data stored in data files
* [Font files](font-files.md) (90X.LFL) are the character sets and fonts used in the game
* [Data files](data-files.md) (DISK0X.LEC) contains the actual data (images, sounds, game logic, etc.)
* Amiga sound files (MUSIC.DAT and SAMPLE.DAT)
* Other files (README.VGA, INSTALL.BAT, _INSTALL.BAT, MONKEY.EXE) are irrelevant for this project

Those files were shipped on either 4 or 8 (3½ or 5¼ inch floppy disks).

Working / tested variants are:

* DOS EGA (4 and 8 disks)
* DOS VGA (4 disks)
* Amiga
* Atari ST

They are all based on [SCUMM](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_Creation_Utility_for_Maniac_Mansion) version 4.

Currently **unsupported** are variants based on SCUMM version 5. Those are:

* DOS CD-ROM
* FM Towns
* Macintosh
* SEGA
* Windows Special Edition (embedded classic DOS CD-ROM version)
